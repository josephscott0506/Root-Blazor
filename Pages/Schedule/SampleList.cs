                        The Scheduler, a.k.a. event calendar, facilitates almost all calendar features, thus allowing users
                        to manage their time efficiently. It features easy resource scheduling, appointments rescheduling through
                        editor pop-ups, drag and drop, and a resizing action. It includes wide variety of view modes with unique
                        configuration options for each view. The available view modes are listed below, out of which the <code>Week</code>
                        view is set as active.
